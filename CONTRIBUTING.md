# Contributing

This repo is maintained by TDK Invensense, and write access to branches is restricted.  
We still welcome your contributions to the project. Please read below to see how you can contribute.

## Issues

When creating an issue, please ping relevant GitHub Team as defined in file [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS).  
This will ensure our support team is properly notified.

## Authorship

It is important to include authorship information in the source files if you want it to be preserved.  
This repo is maintained by squash-merging commits from an internal repo, so individual commit messages will be lost or modified.  

You can simply include lines like the following on a per-file basis:
```
// Contributors: <Author 1> <Author 2>
// Copyright: (c) <year> <Author 1>, (c) <year> <Author 2>
```

Or you can include it at a finer scope if you wish.

## Contribution flow

To start contributing, you will first need to fork this repository. From your fork, you can create branches, make commits, etc. without restriction.  

When you would like to contribute something back to this repo, you should open a pull request to the `main` branch.  
From here, a TDK Invensense member will review the code and decide whether to accept the contribution or not.
